# Botanical Transmissions 
By Andrew Shea, programming by Jay Tobin

## Instructions
Clone this repo locally, and open **Main.maxpat** to get the patch started. **Audio will start upon opening**, so be wary of a high volume setting!

### As of 4/8:

Upload any and all sound files to the "Patches and Audio Files" folder, and if uploading a batch of audio, be sure to remove it from any existing folders.

Sound files **must be below 100mb per file, with a total storage limit of 5gb**.

For now, the patch is a single audio looper with 1 audio file as a proof-of-concept. More to come!
